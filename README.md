# Pile Split  
Given m: the maximum number of elements you can carry in a pile, n: the maximum size pile you can hold, and p: the number of ways you must split a pile if you cannot carry it, how can you divide the piles into ones you can carry yet also ensure the sizes of the piles do not differ by more than 1 (so 2,2,1,1 is acceptable but not 3,2,2,1)?
